# Target Profile: Pocket Monsters Sapphire

## Known repository scope

- Repository: `SakuraiTsubaki/PocketMonsters-Sapphire-Decompilation`
- Working target name: Pocket Monsters Sapphire
- Platform family: Game Boy Advance
- Series generation: Generation III
- Exact release, region, revision, and build: **Japanese retail cartridge, `AXPJ`, revision 0, identified**

The selected reconstruction target is the locally observed Japanese retail cartridge (`AXPJ`, revision 0). Its hashes and header identity are recorded in `config/target.json`; the status remains `identified`, not independently `verified`.

## Identity checklist

Record all available items before substantive reconstruction:

- official title and product identifier;
- platform and execution environment;
- region, language, revision, update, and distribution form;
- hashes for user-supplied images, executables, modules, or manifests;
- executable/container layout and relevant segment identifiers;
- analysis, extraction, compiler, linker, and SDK tool versions;
- legal provenance and distribution constraints for every input;
- differences from related versions that affect addresses, formats, or behavior.

Store machine-readable identifiers in `config/target.json`. Keep the ROM binary outside Git and commit every storable non-ROM result.

## Initial research priorities

- Fingerprint the exact cartridge revision and document the header, memory map, and top-level ROM regions.
- Identify ARM and Thumb code boundaries, calling conventions, compiler fingerprints, and data/code references.
- Map pointer tables, compression, graphics, text, audio, scripts, and other target-specific resource formats.
- Build deterministic extraction and comparison tools around user-supplied, hash-verified inputs.
- Define byte, layout, or behavior-based verification for each reconstructed component.

## First milestone

The foundation milestone is complete when the exact target build is recorded, the initial file/executable map is reproducible, at least one research record has been promoted to an analysis with stated confidence, and all commands needed to repeat that result are documented.

## Non-ROM artifact preservation

Follow [ARTIFACT_POLICY.md](ARTIFACT_POLICY.md). Preserve all storable non-ROM research, source, scripts, tools, logs, manifests, tables, structured data, graphics, sprites, palettes, fonts, icons, tiles, converted data, patches, and verification material. Graphics work must include actual PNG output.
